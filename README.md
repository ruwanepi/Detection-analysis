# Detection-analysis
This is code to replicate the analyses and figures from my August 2020 submission to BMC Medicine entitled **Early detection of cholera 
epidemics to support control in fragile and conflict-affected states: estimated delays and potential impacts**. It presents an analysis of the delays in detection for 79 cholera outbreaks, and model-based estimation of outbreak size at delays.
